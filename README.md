# Introduction
This project is basically [Discox](https://github.com/v1rbox/discox) but support slashing commands.

# Installation
The installation is pretty basic. If you are a discox developer (or contributor), you can (technically) immediately install it!

For the rest, read the [wiki](https://github.com/imindMan/slashcox/wiki)

# Documentation and Help
Always can be found on [wiki](https://github.com/imindMan/slashcox/wiki) page. You should read it.

# Contributing
You can always contribute to this project. I still need some better fixes for my ugly code and so much thing on. The repo always opens

**NOTE**: Right now I don't really plan to maintain this project further, because I also have my study at school (very much I promise). But as always, I welcome everyone to contribute to this project and add more to slashcox, because it lacks a lot of features that discox has. I will just freeze my status of maintaining to this project *actively* and I'll come back whether I have free time. So I really honor if you can help me, even just a little bit.
