    INFO:
    This command is a support command of request, it's used to close the request after reviewing and voting
    Easily by using `v!request_close <number_id>`, which <number_id> is the number_id of the request
    This command only works if the user is an administrator. The bot will detect if you are an administrator by checking your roles. If you have one of the role in the mod_role_id list (assume that you have configured it in the .env file), then you can use this command.

            If the user's reaction is üëç, then the bot will delete the request out of the database (close the request)
            If the user's reaction is üëé, then the bot will ignore your request.

            HOW IT WORKS:
                By default, the request number_id is an attribute with the AUTO_INCREMENT key.
                That's why when deleting a request, we also have to update the number_id and AUTO_INCREMENT key.
                Since we use mysql, we can just ALTER TABLE request AUTO_INCREMENT = (curr_auto_incre - 1)
                For example, assuming we have a database looks like this:
                    1. "Sample request 1" by Foo
                    2. "Sample request 2" by Bar
                    3. "Sample request 3" by Egg

                When we run this command and delete the "Sample request 2" request, the database will look like this:
                Table: request
                    1. "Sample request 1" by Foo
                    3. "Sample request 3" by Egg
                Table: sqlite_sequence
                    name: request, seq: 3

                Since we only have 2 requests left, the sqlite_sequence should be updated like this:
                    name: request, seq: 2 (this way, we can keep track of the number_id correctly in the next time)
                And then, we also need to run a loop, keep track of all the requests and update their number_id.
                So the final result should be:

                Table: request
                    1. "Sample request 1" by Foo
                    2. "Sample request 3" by Egg # the name doesn't matter
                Table: sqlite_sequence
                    name: request, seq: 2
